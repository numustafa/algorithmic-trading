# What is Sentiment Investing means in Trading?
Sentiment investing is a trading strategy that focuses on the overall attitude or sentiment of investors towards a particular security or market. It assumes that public sentiments and emotions can significantly influence market movements, often leading to price changes that may not be justified by fundamental analysis alone. By analyzing sentiment, traders aim to predict future price movements and make informed trading decisions. e.g., using social media (X) sentiment, it might indicate bullish or bearish trends based on the prevailing mood of investors. This approach can be particularly effective in capturing short-term price movements driven by market psychology rather than fundamental factors. 

# Objectives for Project - Sentiment Investing Strategy
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical NASDAQ stocks twitter data, including tweets, sentiment scores, and stock prices.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets (engagement ratio) and assign sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Portfolio Construction**: Create features based on sentiment scores, and ranks all stocks and construct an equal-weight portfolio.
- **Backtesting**: Implement a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the sentiment-based trading strategy. Compare the performance of the sentiment portfolio with a benchmark (e.g., NASDAQ index or NASDAQ performance).

There is no ML involved in this strategy, however, it is a good example to learn how a different type of data can be used to inform trading decisions. The project will focus on the practical application of sentiment analysis in trading, providing insights into how market sentiment can influence stock prices and trading strategies.
